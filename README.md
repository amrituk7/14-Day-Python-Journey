14-Day Python Journey

I'm learning Python from scratch and building small tools related to project planning, operations, and data.

This repo documents my daily progress for 14 days.  
I'm starting simple and improving step by step.

Why I'm Doing This
- To build proof of work
- To grow online by learning in public
- To transition into planning/analytics roles
- To build confidence with Python

Daily Progress
- Day 1 Set up my environment and wrote my first Python script
-  plus Built a simple Project Duration Calculator using Python inputs and basic math.
- Day 2 (will update)
- Day 3 (will update)

 What You'll Find Here
- Small Python scripts (10–20 lines)
- Beginner-friendly logic
- Tools for planning, scheduling, and operations
- My learning notes
